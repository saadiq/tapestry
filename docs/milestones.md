  - Context menu for formatting selected text (bold, italic, headings, lists, links, etc.)
- File tree/sidebar navigation for browsing directories
- Basic file operations (create, open, save, delete, rename)
- Local-first storage (direct filesystem access via Node fs)

### Tech Stack
- Electron with Node 22+
- React + TypeScript
- TipTap (ProseMirror) for WYSIWYG editing
- Electron Forge + Vite for build tooling

## Milestone 2: AI Integration Core
**Goal:** Context-aware AI assistance for documents

### Features
- Claude SDK integration (API key configuration)
- AI sidebar/panel for chat interface
- Basic AI operations:
  - Document summarization
  - Content synthesis across selected files
  - Q&A about document content
- Context management (sending file/folder contents to AI)
- Directory-aware AI (analyze at file, folder, or project level)
- Online/offline state handling (graceful degradation)

### Technical Considerations
- Main process handles Claude SDK calls
- React state management for AI responses
- Queue requests when offline
- Handle API key securely (environment variables)

  - Tag prompts by content type/use case
  - Quick-apply saved prompts to documents
  - Share prompts across projects
- AI-assisted editing (inline suggestions, rewrites, tone adjustments)
- Batch operations (process multiple files with same prompt)

### Data Storage
- SQLite database for prompts and summaries metadata
- Prompts stored with tags, categories, usage count
- Summaries linked to source documents with versioning

### Technical Implementation
- Use libraries like `puppeteer` for PDF, `docx` for Word
- Template engine for customizable exports
- Background processing for large exports

---

## Milestone 6: Plugin Architecture
**Goal:** Extensibility for pulling in external data sources

### Features
- **Plugin System Foundation**:
  - MCP (Model Context Protocol) based plugin architecture
  - Plugin discovery and installation UI
  - Plugin permissions and sandboxing
  - API for plugin developers
- **Core Plugins**:
  - Email integration (pull emails into markdown)
  - Google Docs import plugin
  - Notion import/sync
  - Web clipper (save web content as markdown)
  - Calendar integration (meeting notes)
- Plugin settings and configuration
- Plugin marketplace/directory (basic)

### Developer Experience
- Plugin SDK and documentation

---

## Milestone 7: Cross-Device Access
**Goal:** Work across devices with optional sync

### Features
- **Optional Cloud Sync Backend**:
  - File synchronization across devices
  - Conflict resolution (last-write-wins or manual merge)
  - Selective sync (choose what to sync)
  - End-to-end encryption option
  - Sync status indicators
- **Multi-Device Support**:
  - macOS, Windows, Linux desktop apps
  - Sync settings and preferences
