The problem is of course AI related. There’s greater leverage storing and interacting with documents in markdown fashion but the tools for it kinda suck. That’s the core of it. The more of my stuff I keep in markdown, the more I can leverage it. K is all in service of using AI more effectively. And that’s why the cursor that doesn’t presume sw engineering. It’s all the stuff I’m already doing in claude code but made more accessible.

Oh, uh, this markdown editor. It needs to be an AI powered Markdown editor. And by that, I mean, essentially, cursor without the software engineering focus.  Um, I think the core pieces of it are the markdown, uh, in a bear app sort of format. Except the big challenge with bears that it just assumes that you are only working from your notes repository. It utilizes markdown but the single repository setup doesn't work well for a projects focus. Instead, this needs to be able to be pointed at any director of repository of information, to be able to see the directory structure, edit the individual files, synthesizer them as a group, as a directory, um, maybe pin summaries or refocus summaries towards other, um, intentions.  Uh, it needs to be able to export files to go from markdown to what the rest of the world wants to work in, be it a PDF, be it a, um, a Word doc or whatever. Uh, doesn't need to import those things, possibly, possibly. Um, there is the question of, is it a cloud app, or is it a desktop app which sinks to other desktop apps?  Right now, I have a few apps think it is a desktop app with sync capability. Is it with sync capability? DVD.  Like, right now, it is focused on directories of things that are on the file system. Um... I do think there is a... an upsell to sort of sinking functionality, so that it can be used on the roads that you can interact with it, um, via your phone, um, so you can see these documents, and maybe within that, there is also, essentially, notation, uh, voice dictation, voice transcription, in order, as inputs into this thing.  It also... It also is trying to be that, um, that AI brain thing. What I've been trying to do with Obsidian to a certain extent.

Another core element is just right now LLMs allow us as individuals to synthesize a large amount of data that we have not been able to do individually in the past and that's why we relied upon Google's and Facebook's and all these other larger companies to do this thing at scale which leads to sort of advertising models and all these things but now we can do it and I believe that some portion of this future is us individually leveraging all of our data and not having to have it locked up in silos like even granola the note-taking app isn't really eager to enable off-ramps to allow you to get your data out of there they don't want to be a dome pipe they want to be a destination and I get that for them but I don't really want that for me so the idea of this being driven by what is on your file system and potentially having the ability to sync it elsewhere but it being sort of looking at your file system and it able to pull in particular information like to have a little project set up for a potential client and then to have a plug-in that allows you to go and pull the emails from your inbox about a subject or with this person and then create a directory with those in markdown so that you can synthesize them or pull in Google Docs or convert Word Docs or whatever else but this can be this can be sort of the lodestone which allows you to have gravity and pull your information into a place that you control is I think valuable with these tools and compelling.

I think a lot of the audience is just sort of knowledge workers generally. They don't have to be sort of open source advocates or so much can care about the sovereignty of their information. What they care about is the outcomes, the leverage that is created by using this and some part of this software is going to be an instantiation of the best practices that I as an early adopter have figured out in order to help them execute better with these tools. So like at first blush, it's a markdown under it allows you to edit markdown more easily. But second and third order stuff are the way it encourages you to execute focused summaries of things and pin those summaries in order in service of a particular action because one summary of a meeting can't possibly serve all purposes for instance.

It isn't just a markdown editor. The markdown, after all, is a means to the AI end. It's a text editor. A document creator. AI and thus markdown are enablers to that end.

The premise is really that in an AI powered age, we are responsible for the context engineering. We are no longer responsible for just penning a particular document, but instead for managing the sources and seeds for all of our documents and all of our communications. As people say, garbage in, garbage out. We are responsible for making sure we aren't putting garbage in. We have to curate and tend that garden to make sure that the source material is high quality and focused. And from that, we can use this app to synthesize many different outputs. Context is everything. Making sure you have the right documents informing a new creation. Making sure you have the appropriate summaries or prompts to shape those inputs. Helping users assemble and synthesize that context to get better outcomes.

This sets the stage for a future in which both the creator and recipient of a document are leveraging AI tools. To receive the document that tells a story, but also be able to interrogate the source material and understanding the framing implicit in the prompts is powerful. Prompts and hand written portions would be held constant, while generated content could be regenerated. To be able to refine or pressure test an argument... to be able to add additional source material to see how that improves or affects the analysis. Context engineering on a team scale.

potential for future collaborative/teams feature set allowing people to not just share documents but also context as indicated by the last paragraph. Document + prompts/guidance + context. Perhaps also capturing feedback as another bit of context for future iterations on that subject.
