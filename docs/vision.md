# Your AI-powered document workspace

## The Problem

In an AI-powered world, we've become context engineers rather than just document creators. While AI tools have given individuals unprecedented ability to synthesize large amounts of data, the infrastructure for managing this context remains fragmented. Current tools either lock data in proprietary silos (like note-taking apps with no export options) or assume narrow use cases (like Cursor's software engineering focus). Knowledge workers need a way to leverage their entire corpus of information—emails, documents, notes, meeting transcripts—in a unified, AI-ready format that they control.

The real challenge isn't just editing text; it's curating, organizing, and synthesizing the high-quality source material that feeds AI outputs. Without proper context management, we're left with "garbage in, garbage out"—limiting the transformative potential of AI tools.

## The Audience

**Primary:** Knowledge workers who need to synthesize information from multiple sources—consultants, researchers, project managers, writers, strategists. They care less about data sovereignty philosophy and more about practical leverage: getting better outputs from AI by managing better inputs.

**Secondary:** Early AI adopters who understand that prompt engineering alone isn't enough—context engineering is the next frontier. They're already cobbling together workflows across multiple tools and want something purpose-built.

## Key Features

### Core Functionality

- **Flexible Markdown Editor**: Point at any directory or repository on your file system, not just a single notes database
- **Directory-Aware AI**: Synthesize content at file, folder, or project level with context-aware AI assistance
- **Dynamic Summaries**: Create and pin multiple purpose-driven summaries of the same content (e.g., different meeting summaries for different stakeholders)
- **Smart Export**: Convert markdown to PDF, Word, or other formats the world expects

### Context Management

- **Plugin Architecture**: Pull emails, Google Docs, or other data sources into markdown directories for synthesis
- **Project Workspaces**: Organize client or project-specific contexts with all relevant materials
- **Context Curation Tools**: Best-practice templates and workflows for organizing source material effectively
- **Prompt Library**: Store and reuse effective prompts tied to specific types of content or outputs

### Desktop-First with Sync

- **Local File System Integration**: Work directly with your existing file structure
- **Optional Cloud Sync**: Access and update documents across devices
- **Mobile Companion**: Voice transcription and notation for on-the-go input

## Future Vision: Team-Scale Context Engineering

### The Collaborative Opportunity (Premium/Enterprise Tier)

Moving beyond individual productivity to team-scale context engineering:

**Shared Context Repositories**

- Teams share not just final documents, but the entire context that created them
- Recipients can interrogate source material and understand framing assumptions
- Prompts and hand-written sections remain constant while generated content can be regenerated with new context

**Collaborative Intelligence**

- Add team members' context to improve analysis
- Pressure-test arguments by adjusting source materials
- Track how different contexts affect outcomes

**Feedback as Context**

- Capture reviews and feedback as additional context for future iterations
- Build institutional knowledge through accumulated context and successful prompt patterns
- Version control for both content and context

This transforms documentation from static artifacts into living, interrogatable knowledge systems where both creators and consumers can refine, challenge, and build upon the underlying context—making AI augmentation truly collaborative rather than just individual.
