/**
 * INTEGRATION TESTING STRATEGY
 *
 * These tests are currently placeholders due to the complexity of testing
 * the full App component with its nested provider structure.
 *
 * ## Current Test Coverage
 *
 * âœ… **Unit Tests (Complete)**
 * - useFileContent.test.ts: Comprehensive coverage of save/load logic
 * - pathUtils.test.ts: Cross-platform path handling
 * - Individual component tests (where applicable)
 *
 * ## Missing Integration Tests
 *
 * The following scenarios require full FileTreeProvider integration:
 *
 * 1. **Save-Before-Switch Flow**
 *    - User modifies file A
 *    - User clicks file B in tree
 *    - File A auto-saves before switching
 *    - If save fails, switch is blocked and error shown
 *
 * 2. **Window Blur Auto-save**
 *    - User modifies file
 *    - Window loses focus (blur event)
 *    - File auto-saves after debounce
 *    - Large files (>5MB) skip blur save with warning
 *
 * 3. **File Watcher Integration**
 *    - External modification of open file (clean state): Auto-reload
 *    - External modification of open file (dirty state): Show warning
 *    - File save event from app: Ignore (tracked via activeSaves Map)
 *
 * 4. **Error Recovery**
 *    - Save failure shows error toast with retry button
 *    - Retry button triggers new save attempt
 *    - File tree dirty state persists until successful save
 *
 * ## Recommended Testing Approach
 *
 * ### Option 1: Manual Testing Checklist
 * Create a comprehensive manual test plan covering:
 * - File switching with/without unsaved changes
 * - Window blur with different file sizes
 * - External file modifications
 * - Network drive scenarios (slow I/O)
 * - Error conditions (permissions, disk full, etc.)
 *
 * ### Option 2: E2E Tests (Future)
 * Use Playwright or similar to test the Electron app:
 * - Simulates real user interactions
 * - Can trigger window events (blur, focus)
 * - Can modify files externally
 * - More reliable than mocking providers
 *
 * ### Option 3: Custom Test Utilities
 * Create test wrapper components that:
 * - Provide mock FileTreeProvider with controlled state
 * - Expose helper methods to trigger file operations
 * - Simplify integration test setup
 *
 * ## Current Recommendation
 *
 * Given the project stage and complexity:
 * 1. Rely on existing unit tests for core logic (95%+ coverage)
 * 2. Perform manual testing for integration scenarios
 * 3. Consider E2E tests when moving to production
 *
 * The unit tests provide strong confidence in individual components,
 * while manual testing validates the full user experience.
